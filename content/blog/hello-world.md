We've just come online and hope to provide up to date, easy to read documentation for the Signum
crypto currency. The goal to provide documentation for the technical back end such as the peer-to-peer API, the user and app API,
and the way data is cryptographically signed and stored.

This site is not necessarily intended for user-based tutorials, and the focus for contributers should not be on providing how-to's
for various Signum related software. Instead, it's designed to allow developers to understand the Signum node and its interactions.

Please enjoy learning about Signum software.
