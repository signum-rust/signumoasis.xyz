## What is Signum?

Signum is a distributed blockchain technology based on a proof of capacity and stake instead of a proof of work.
Similar to other blockchains, Signum has its own digital currency called Signa. However, it also hosts hundreds of
other 'tokens' that can be traded just like Signa with a built-in marketplace.

Signum has smart contracts built in that allow the creation of games, decentralized exchanges, lotteries, and any
other technology that can benefit from blockchain. The Signum platform's capability, open development, constant evolution,
and low energy cost make it a particularly effective choice to move into the future of blockchain technologies.

This documentation is designed to serve as a reference for the programmers building the Signum platform. As such, it
may be beyond the understanding many users, and those interested in the user side should check out [https://www.signum.network/](https://www.signum.network/) instead, or [join the official Signum discord server](https://discord.gg/8XpJqxsD3F).
