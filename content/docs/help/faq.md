## What is Signum?

Signum is a proof-of-capacity-and-stake crypto currency. It is less electrically demanding than almost any other coin
and encourages the recycling of hard drives, extending the useful life of even dying hard drives, and delaying their
entry into landfills.

See the official [Signum Network website](http://signum.network) for more information.
